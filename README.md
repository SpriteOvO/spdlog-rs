Fast, highly configurable Rust logging crate, inspired by the C++ logging library [spdlog].

## Features

 - Very fast (see [Benchmarks]).
 - Asynchronous support.
 - Compatible with `log` crate.
 - Custom log formats:
   - compile-time zero-cost pattern or runtime pattern;
   - manually implementing for more flexibility.
 - Various combinable sinks:
    - standard streams with optional color support;
    - files (single file, rotating hourly, daily, periodically or by file size);
    - platform-specific (e.g. `journald` for Linux and `OutputDebugStringW` for Windows);
    - ... and able to implement one yourself.
 - Configuring via environment variables or TOML[^1].
 - More readable level filters.

[^1]: TOML deserialization support is working in progress, tracking issue [#25]

## Getting started

Add this to `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
spdlog-rs = "0.3"
```

The documentation of this crate is hosted on [docs.rs], and you can learn examples under [./examples] directory along with it.

## Supported Rust versions

<!--
When updating this, also update:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- src/lib.rs
- Cargo.toml
-->

The current minimum supported Rust version is 1.60.

`spdlog-rs` is built against the latest Rust stable release, it is not guaranteed to build on Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.

`spdlog-rs` follows the compiler support policy that the latest stable version and the 3 most recent minor versions before that are always supported. For example, if the current latest Rust stable version is 1.61, the minimum supported version will not be increased past 1.58. Increasing the minimum supported version is not considered a semver breaking change as long as it complies with this policy.
