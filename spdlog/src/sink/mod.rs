//! Provides sinks to flexibly output log messages to specified targets.
//!
//! # Sink
//!
//! Sinks are the objects that actually write logs to their targets. Each sink
//! should be responsible for only single target (e.g file, console, database),
//! and each sink has its own private instance of [`Formatter`] object.
//!
//! A sink has its own level filter that is not shared with the logger, and a
//! [`Logger`] can combine multiple [`Sink`]s.
//!
//! # Combined sink
//!
//! A combined sink is also a sink, but instead of having its own target and
//! formatter, it combines other sinks (as sub-sinks).
//!
//! Operations on a combined sink will be forwarded to its sub-sinks according
//! to the implementation.
